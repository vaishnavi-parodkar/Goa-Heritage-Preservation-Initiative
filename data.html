          <h2>Se Cathedral</h2>
          <p>The Se Cathedral, located in Old Goa, is one of the largest churches in Asia and a prominent example of
            Portuguese-Manueline architecture. It was built to commemorate the victory of the Portuguese over the Muslim
            rulers of the region in 1510, under the leadership of Afonso de Albuquerque. Dedicated to Saint Catherine of
            Alexandria, the cathedral took over 80 years to complete and was consecrated in 1640.

            This grand structure is known for its impressive Gothic-style architecture, with Tuscan exteriors and
            Corinthian interiors. The cathedral once had two towers, but one collapsed in 1776 and was never rebuilt.
            The highlight of the interior is the “Golden Bell,” which is famed for its rich tone and is one of the
            largest in Goa.

            Se Cathedral stands as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and serves as a symbol of Goa's colonial legacy and
            religious harmony. It continues to attract tourists and devotees from around the world for its spiritual
            significance and architectural beauty.</p>

          <h2>Shri Mangeshi Temple</h2>
          <p>The Shri Mangeshi Temple, situated in the village of Mangeshi in Ponda, is one of the most revered and
            iconic Hindu temples in Goa. Dedicated to Lord Mangesh, an incarnation of Lord Shiva, the temple is known
            for its elegant Goan temple architecture, including a seven-story deepstambha (lamp tower) and beautiful
            domes. Originally located in Kushasthali (Cortalim), the deity was shifted to its current location during
            the Portuguese era to protect it from destruction. The temple is a major center of pilgrimage and spiritual
            heritage in Goa.</p>
